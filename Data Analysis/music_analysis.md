## üß© 1. Analyzing Trends Over Time

**Question:**  
How has the energy and danceability of songs changed over time (from 2010 to 2011 in this dataset)?

**Findings:**  
- The average song energy remained around **76.18**, showing **no major change** across the decade (2010‚Äì2011).  
- The correlation between year and danceability was **-0.038**, indicating **no strong trend**.  
- Overall, music style and tempo **remained relatively stable** during this period.

**Patterns observed:**  
- Songs from 2010‚Äì2011 had very similar energy and dance levels.  
- All tracks fall within the same decade group (2010s), confirming consistency in production style.

## üéµ 2. Comparing Genres

**Question:**  
Which genres are the most danceable?

**What surprised me:**  
Acoustic songs were **much calmer and less danceable** than expected, and their **valence (happiness)** was also quite low.

**Patterns observed:**  
- **Electronic songs** are upbeat, energetic, and suited for dancing.

- The biggest difference was in **acousticness**, which was **44% higher** in popular tracks.  
- Surprisingly, **valence (happiness)** was a bit lower in popular songs.

**Question:**  
Do high-energy songs tend to be more danceable?  
What features show strong relationships?

- Strongest overall correlations:
  - **Energy ‚Üî Acoustics:** -0.64 ‚Üí High-energy songs are less acoustic.  
  - **Energy ‚Üî Valence:** 0.59 ‚Üí Energetic songs are often happier.  
  - **Dance ‚Üî Valence:** 0.50 ‚Üí Danceable songs tend to be more positive.

**What surprised me:**
